# Another YouTube Downloader

Just another tool for downloading YouTube videos. Nothing really special, except simple.

- Based on .NET 6
- Cross-platform
- No GUI but CUI is cool

Thanks to [YouTubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) and [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console), and all other libraries.
